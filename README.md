# Illegal Parking Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a system for detecting illegal parking using drones. The system will utilize computer vision techniques to identify vehicles parked in prohibited areas and send alerts to the authorities.

> **Note:** This project is developed as part of the course project for MECH420 - Introduction to Drones at Qatar University.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) (extract to folder and add to PATH environment variable)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/MFauzanAP/Illegal-Parking-Detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the motion detection script: `python motion_detection.py "DATASET_PATH"`
4. View the results in the `combined-output` directory (or `output` for individual images).
